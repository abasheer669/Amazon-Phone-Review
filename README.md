# Amazon-Phone-Review
This is our projects in Big data. In this project, we explore the Amazon phone dataset to view: How the customer views on different mobile brands?

For more details on the project, and its result please check out the  files in the repository.

The focus on research shifts from trends popular all over the world to brands recently popular in mobiles like: Samsung, Apple.

We use MonogDB compass for storing the orginal dataset as well as the one which is scrapped from orginal with help of Pandas.

This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of Pandas and Numpy dataframeworks in Python(spyder). The output graphs were produced using the Matplotlib library.

This project is helpful for anyone looking for an introduction to these frameworks.
